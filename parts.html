			<h1 class="pheader" id="mtb">The Motherboard</h1>
			<p class="ptext">The motherboard grasps the small devices that are needed for the PC to function. These parts include: CPU, memory 
			chips (RAM and ROM), expansion slots, power connectors and any other microchips required for the PC to function. </p>

			<img class="parts2" width="204" height="212" align="left" src="cpu.jpg" alt="The CPU.">
			<h1 class="pheader" id="cpu">The CPU</h1>
			<p class="ptext2"> The CPU (Computer Processing Unit) is a very small device and could be thought of as the mind as the PC. This component 
			has two responsibilities: It has to make the other hardware components perform specific actions,and it performs the basic logical, input/output, 
			control, and arithmetic operations identified by the instructions. There may be many millions of instructions executed by the CPU every second.</p>

			<img class="parts2" width="230" height="135" align="left" src="ram.jpg" alt="The RAM in a computer.">
			<h1 class="pheader" id="ram">The RAM</h1>
			<p class="ptext2">The RAM (Random Access Memory) temporarily stores the information that all the different components in  a PC use. The information 
			inside the RAM will automatically be lost forever once the PC is shut down or reset. For example, RAM is used by the CPU when a computer is running 
			to store information that it needs to be used very quickly, but it does not store any information permanently.</p>

			<img class="parts2" width="230" height="180" align="left" src="harddrive.jpg" alt="The hard drive in a computer.">
			<h1 class="pheader" id="hd">The Hard Drive</h1>
			<p class="ptext2">The hard drive stores the data from the RAM that is wanted to be kept permanently. The hard drive is divided into directories, 
			which are also known as folders. You can go to the directories to access the data stored.</p>

			<img class="parts2" width="209" height="261" align="left" src="psupply.jpg" alt="The power supply in a computer.">
			<h1 class="pheader" id="psup">The Power Supply</h1>
			<p class="ptext2">A power supply is an electrical device that gives electric power/energy to power to computer. The most important function of 
			a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the current, correct voltage, and frequency to power the load. Power supplies are 
			referred to as electric power converters. All power supplies have a power input connection. It receives energy in the form of electric current from 
			a source and one or more power output connections that deliver current to the load. </p>

			<img class="parts2" width="224" height="217" align="left" src="hs.jpg" alt="The heat sink in a computer.">
			<h1 class="pheader" id="hs">The Heat Sink</h1>
			<p class="ptext2">A heat sink is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid 
			medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature at 
			optimal levels. heat sinks are used to cool central processing units or graphics processors. Additionally, it is uses  high-power semiconductor 
			devices (ie. power transistors and optoelectronics),  where it can moderate the computer’s temperature.</p>

			<img class="parts2" width="250" height="198" align="left" src="cdd.jpg" alt="The CD drive in a computer.">
			<h1 class="pheader" id="cdd">The CD Drive</h1>
			<p class="ptext2">A CD drive is a device a computer uses to read data encoded digitally on a compact disk. The code on the disk is written in 1’s 
			and 0’s just like the code written for computers. When it first came out in 1985, it was said to be too expensive, and was mostly used for large 
			databases, since the general public also had no use for them. By the early 1990s, newer and more powerful computers entered the scene, and new 
			games that were too big for the floppy disk were introduced on the CD. </p>

			<img class="parts" width="150" height="274" align="left" src="vidc.jpg" alt="The video card in a computer.">
			<h1 class="pheader" id="vidc">The Video Card</h1>
			<p class="ptext2">A video card is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display. Frequently, these are advertised as 
			discrete or dedicated graphics cards, emphasizing the distinction between these and integrated graphics.</p>
			<hr class="phr">
			<img class="parts2" width="200" height="234" align="left" src="es.jpg" alt="The expansion slots in a computer.">
			<h1 class="pheader" id="es">The Expansion Slots</h1>
			<p class="ptext2">In computing, the expansion card is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion 
			slot, on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus.</p>
